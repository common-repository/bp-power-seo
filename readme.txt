== Description ==

WordPress SEO plugins don't do the job for BuddyPress. This plugin solves that.

BP Power SEO brings powerful SEO features to your BuddyPress installation. Now your social network or community can be supercharged for Google!

BP Power SEO creates XML sitemaps that you can submit to Google, Bing, Yahoo!, Yandex, Baidu, etc. to dramatically increase your discoverability. You can configure the sitemap to enable or disable members sitemap, groups sitemap, and searches (autolinks) sitemap.

BP Power SEO also enables you to rewrite titles for BuddyPress pages, similar to how WordPress SEO plugins enable you to do so for WordPress posts/pages.

Finally, BP Power SEO brings your community into the Semantic Web, with structured data, also known as Google Rich Snippets. Structured data markup is added to member and group pages. You can easily map the user XProfile fields to schema.org fields.
